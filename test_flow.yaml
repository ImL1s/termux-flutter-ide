# Depending on the file picker implementation, this might vary.
# If it's a custom file picker within the app (which I think it is based on code I saw earlier),
# we can navigate.
# Let's assume we can select a folder.
# If the app uses system pickle, Maestro handles it poorly.
# BUT, looking at `file_tree_view.dart`, it seems to be using `file_selector` or similar?
# Let's try to just select the default directory if possible or navigate.
# For now, let's see if we can just "Run" if verify that we are in editor.
